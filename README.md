## Summary

The days of picking baby names from movies and TV shows, or even family 
members, is over! It's finally time to use artificial intelligence as it was
meant for -- generating baby names! This app will use OpenAI to help you name
your child based on a number of factors. You can choose between boy names,
girl names, or unisex names which can be filtered by nationality, popularity,
uniqueness, and preferred names! So what are you waiting for? Name your child
today with the AI Baby Name Generator!

## Goals

- **Utilize creative AI** to generate baby names.
- Provide an **interface** with AI.
- **Save** favorite names to a database.
- Allow **customization** with user options.
- Provide the world with a **new era of names**.

## Customers and Stakeholders

### Customers

The customers of this app will be expecting parents who are looking for a 
unique name for their child. They will be able to choose from a variety of 
options to customize their search for the perfect name. They may use our 
service to create a memorable name for their child -- perhaps even a name
that has never been used before!

### Stakeholders

The stakeholders of this app will be the developers and investors. The
developers will be responsible for creating the app and maintaining it. The 
investors will be responsible for funding the app and ensuring that it is 
profitable. This app could be a profitable endeavor if structured properly.
Since the app is a program which is based on OpenAI API, a paid service, it
would be necessary to charge either on a per-use basis or via a subscription
model. With this being said, this project would easily be a profitable
endeavor.

## Technologies

### Front-End

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Back-End

- Java
- Thymeleaf
- Java Spring
- H2 SQL Database

### Services

- OpenAI API
- HTTPS

### Step 1: HTTPS Requests in Java

The first step will be to create a simple web app which can make HTTPS
requests to the OpenAI API. This will be done using Java and would be a simple
beginning to the project. This step would build the model for the project and
would be the foundation for the rest of the project. This step may be
completed quickly for those who are experienced with Java and HTTPS requests.

### Step 2: Web User Interface

The second step will be to create a user interface which will allow the user
to input their preferences for the baby name. This will be done using HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript. This will start to connect the back-end to the front-end.
This may take a plurality of time to complete. Server-side programming will be
used to connect the front-end to the back-end via Thymeleaf and Java Spring.
For those who have built web severs before, this step may be translatable from
other languages.

### Step 3: Persistence

The third step will be to create a database which will store the user's 
favorite names. This will be done using H2 SQL Database. This will allow the
user to save their favorite names for later use. This step will involve 
securely making user accounts and storing user data with the safety of 
HTTPS/SSL and encryption. For people experienced with databases and 
encryption, this step may be completed faster than the previous step.
